#StampPaper
This project acts as an inventory system to keep a record of purchases, sales of [stamp papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamped_paper). The motivation for the project was to simplify things for our business. Using this code the balance of stamp papers could be kept with great ease including keeping records of all the incoming and outgoing stamp papers.
